# Python GUI calculator with body mass index calculation


It's a simple calculator designed using the tkinter python gui library that can be used as a calculator for daily use and has the bmi calculation function.

The main motivation behind these projects is to learn about GUI development using the Python programming language. There are various Python libraries available for graphical user interface development, and TKinter is one of them. In this GUI-based calculator, I've used one console window to display the result's and an entry widget to take the data from the user as input. There are various numeric buttons and also special operation buttons to perform the computational task.
For normal computational use, we can use the calculator without any mode settings, but for BMI calculation, we have to enable the BMI mode button. This will enable the user window to be able to take the height and weight data from the user, and after pressing the equate button, display the result on the result bar.

Python projects can be used as software applications once the normal Python project file is converted into an executable file.
